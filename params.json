Assmann\r\n\r\nwien2wannier is an interface program between WIEN2k and Wannier90 to obtain maximally localized Wannier functions from WIEN2k calculations.\r\n\r\nwien2wannier is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License. In addition, we ask that you cite\r\n\r\nJ. Kuneš, R. Arita, P. Wissgott, A. Toschi, H. Ikeda, K. Held, Comp. Phys. Commun. 181, 1888 (2010)\r\n\r\nin any publications arising from the use of wien2wannier. Remember to also cite Wannier90 if you use it in conjunction with wien2wannier. For details see the file COPYING.\r\n\r\nWIEN2WANNIER 1.0 is included in the WIEN2k_14.2 distribution; to use it, simply install the latest WIEN2k version. WIEN2WANNIER-specific documentation is included in SRC_w2w/. For reference, a complete copy of WIEN2WANNIER is provided Initiates file downloadhere.\r\n\r\nChanges from v. 0.97 include:\r\n\r\n    WIEN2k integration\r\n        (most) wien2wannier programs can be called through x\r\n        installation in existing WIEN2k directory\r\n    write_inwf replaces write_w2win and brings new features, e.g.\r\n        it knows about the real-valued spherical harmonics (s through f), s/p/d hybrids, and certain symmetry-related groups (e.g. d-t2g)\r\n        an arbitrary rotation can be applied to each initial projection\r\n        tab-completion, readline and history support\r\n    fix handling of k-points for all lattice types\r\n    w2w sets the Fermi energy to zero (i.e. shift_energy is no longer part of the standard procedure)\r\n\r\nCaveat: woptic has been removed from this package and does not yet work together with the 1.0-series of wien2wannier. If you want to use woptic, please continue to use wien2wannier 0.97 for now.\r\n\r\nBugfixes and changes in 1.0 (as of 2014-10-16) inlcude:\r\n\r\n    removed all Unicode (non-ASCII) characters from the messages printed by WIEN2WANNIER, they were causing problems for some users\r\n    guiding centers are enabled by default in case.win\r\n    added -efermi, -scf switches (to specify Fermi energy) to prepare_w2wdir\r\n    fixed a bug in wplot2xsf --xsf-files in the case of multiple files\r\n    fixed a bug in x relating to x joinvec -p \r\n\r\nFor details see the file NEWS included in the distribution.\r\n\r\nThe last pre-1.0 version is still available: Initiates file downloadwien2wannier 0.97\r\n\r\nQuestions relating to the usage of WIEN2WANNIER should be sent to the WIEN2k mailing list. As regards Wannier90 and the MLWF procedure, there is a separate mailing list.\r\n\r\nComments to the maintainer of WIEN2WANNIER can be sent to wien2wannier@ifp.tuwien.ac.at.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
